# üéØ Reddit Battle Royale Trivia - Hackathon Submission

## Inspiration

The inspiration for **Reddit Battle Royale Trivia** came from the explosive popularity of battle royale games and Reddit's incredible community knowledge. We wanted to create something that would bring redditors together in a fun, competitive way while celebrating the platform's culture.

Watching communities like r/todayilearned and r/AskReddit generate endless fascinating discussions, we realized there was untapped potential for a game that could turn Reddit's collective wisdom into an exciting multiplayer experience. The idea of "last player standing" combined with trivia felt perfect for Reddit's competitive yet educational spirit.

We also wanted to showcase how Kiro could revolutionize the development experience, turning what would typically be weeks of complex multiplayer game development into a streamlined, AI-assisted workflow.

## What it does

**Reddit Battle Royale Trivia** is a massively multiplayer elimination-style trivia game built directly into Reddit posts. Here's how it works:

üéÆ **Core Gameplay:**
- Players join a battle royale-style trivia competition
- Questions are presented with multiple choice answers
- Wrong answers eliminate players instantly
- The last player standing wins the battle!

üåü **Key Features:**
- **Unlimited Players**: Supports massive multiplayer sessions
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Questions get harder as rounds advance
